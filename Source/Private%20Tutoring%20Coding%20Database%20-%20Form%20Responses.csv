(p. 12)

""the data illustrate the general notion that national and cross-national patterns of shadow education lead to an important institutional perspective on modern schooling. The widespread prevalence of shadow education and the intensity of its use in schooling processes of students and families dramatically underscores the degree to which education increasingly dominates the structure of childhood and child-rearing... As schooling becomes  the primary institution for the generation of knowledge and its transmission to generations of children in the form of achievement, one may expect the continued growth in outside-school activities that are specially aimed at child's performance within schools. (p. 13)

As mass schooling as a world  norm continues to intensify the importance of schooling, shadow education itself becomes an institutionalized component of mass education that grows and expands. (p. 14)

""shadow education loosens the boundaries between public control of education and private education activities"" (p. 14)

""...education policymakers should appreciate the ability of widespread shadow education to add a significant non-public component to the process without the production of full-scale private schools. This has the potential to change the governance structure of education by introducing private services to a wider host of families and students, hence merging families and private educational resources into new institutional arrangements"" (14).

Education is known to promote social mobility and therefore contributes to improving equity (Orbeta, 2005). This situation eventually prompts parents to seek for their children, a competitive edge over their peers through tutorial services as their financial resources allow. Those at the lower portion of the socioeconomic strata fear of being left behind if they do not receive tutoring (Bray, 2006; Paviot et al., 2008). In the process, major issues of equity are involved. Since future life chances in most settings are closely linked to achievement in education systems, students‚Äô future employment may be significantly shaped by whether they have undergone tutoring (Kim, 2004).
